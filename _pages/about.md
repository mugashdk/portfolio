Write your biography here. I have been working in business development and innovation for over 10 years. I have experience in research, policy development, fundraising, donor management, and leading complex public and private sector projects. My focus has been on driving change towards a more automated approach to doing business in Kenya. I have also represented Kenya in high-level technology transformation events across the globe. Due to my involvement in enhancing the ease of doing business in Kenya, the country has seen a rise of 15 points on the World Bank ranking. Currently, I run a consultancy practice that supports and improves operational efficiencies of agribusinesses. I'm always excited to connect with like-minded professionals who share my vision of creating a better world through innovation and entrepreneurship. Please feel free to reach out if you want to discuss anything related to business development, innovation, investment promotion, or anything else that might pique your interest.. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
